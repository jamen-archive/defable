## Credits

References I used for code:

- A large amount of [fabletlcmod.com](http://fabletlcmod.com)'s wiki and forum posts.
- Discussion with [Fable Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/Sv8P6Ef) particularly [shiftweave](https://github.com/blastedt), Etem, and sei6r.
- Anonymous dude who _may or may not_ have dropped me a development build of Fable TLC for Xbox. :slightly_smiling_face:
- Stumbling around in a hex editor until some stuff makes sense.
